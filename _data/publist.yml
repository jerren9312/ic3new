  description: Can mesoscopic shot noise experiments show the doubling of the charge carriers in a superconductor? Turns out, it's complicated. We investigated this in several different samples, and made predictions as to what is necessary to make this work.

  description: Why does cuprate superconductivity break down at a certain doping level? Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy we find that an emerging metallic matrix inside the superconducting state is responsible for the overall reduction of Tc and the superfluid density, while leaving the gapsize unchanged. The formation of the matrix is tied to a pair breaking process violating a core principle of mean-field theories.
